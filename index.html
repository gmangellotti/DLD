    <h4 style="color: #457b9dff; font-size: 40px; text-shadow: 1px 1px #f1faeeff;">As I told mom I’m not the best at getting gifts, and you might be the most difficult person
I can think of to get a gift for. Mostly because you are not very materialistic, which is something I’ve understood more and more as I’ve been growing up these past few years. I won’t go into everything that you’ve instilled into me as I’ve grown up and I know we are not always the most sentimental, but for as long as I can remember you have always been the person that I’ve looked up to the most. You’ve always been my hero since I was a little kid, wanting to be like you in so many ways. It’s as I’ve grown up and been in college around other kids that I’ve truly realized how grateful I am to have parents like you and mom to raise me. I know all the sacrifices that you’ve made for me and Gabi and that is something that I feel I can never repay you for, even though I will try my absolute best. Although I don’t know the future that I have in regards to starting a family, but one of my main motivations to start one is to give you the opportunity to have a relationship with my kids like Papa and I had. Maybe that's why me and papa had such a special relationship is because you and him are very alike and I know that you would have just as strong of a relationship with my kids as Papa and I had, which is something that I am hopeful for everyday. Thanks dad and I love you.
